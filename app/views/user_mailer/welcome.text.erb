Get excited!!! You'll never be scrambling for new music again. And now that you're part of our discovery community, neither will we!

Here's how Splash.FM works:

1. Post tracks you're currently obsessed with (or as we call it, 'Splash' them).
2. Follow your friends and other go-to music sources to check out what they're Splashing.
3. We'll aggregate all of the Splashes by the people you follow into your own, personalized "Splashboard."

Lastly--NOT to sound like your mom, but Splash wisely!!! The more people that follow you and re-Splash your music, the higher your Splash Score will be.

And of course you know, no one listens to someone with a low Splash Score...

So get going. Jump in!!!
