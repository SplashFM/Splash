  Get excited!!! You'll never be scrambling for new music again. And now that
  you're part of our discovery community, neither will we!

%p Here's how Splash.FM works:

%ol
  %li
    Post tracks you're currently obsessed with (or as we call it, 'Splash' them).
  %li
    Follow your friends and other go-to music sources to check out what they're
    Splashing.
  %li
    We'll aggregate all of the Splashes by the people you follow into your
    own, personalized "Splashboard."

%p
  Lastly&mdash;NOT to sound like your mom, but Splash wisely!!! The more people
  that follow you and re-Splash your music, the higher your Splash Score will be.

%p And of course you know, no one listens to someone with a low Splash Score...

%p So get going. Jump in!!!
