          When you Splash a song, you are telling all of your friends and followers, "This song is awesome. Check it out!"

          Whenever a friend or follower re-Splashes that song, you earn a Ripple.

          You can Splash by simply clicking the droplet next to any song, searching for a song you already know, or uploading from your personal stash.
      five:
        body: |
          Follow your friends whose music taste you trust to see the tracks they are Splashing. Re-Splash the songs you discover and love.
      four:
        body: |
          The more people re-Splash your music, the higher your Splash Score will be. In other words, your Splash Score measures your influence in music.

          That's it! You're ready to start Splashing...
